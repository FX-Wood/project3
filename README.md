## Day 1
The best thing about working as a group is that everyone comes with different ideas and opinions, so that's exactly how we started.
We began by throwing some ideas around and seeing what the interest level was in each. Given the parameters of our project - in essence, a MERN app - we were able to discard certain ideas based on their lack of suitability.
The idea we settled on was PROPS, an application with a focus on employee engagement. The basic premise was that employees could give others props for a job well done, a shout-out that would draw attention to their good work.
Given the nature of the final product, it was decided that the more prudent move would be to create an app focused towards desktop use, rather than mobile. The (extremely witty and clever) name, PROPS, was decided upon due to the function the app was performing, in addition to the front end being built in React.
